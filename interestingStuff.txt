Extract
Chapter 1: Into Programming

Welcome to the You Don't Know JS (YDKJS) series.

Up & Going is an introduction to several basic concepts of programming -- of course we lean toward JavaScript (often abbreviated JS) specifically -- and how to approach and understand the rest of the titles in this series. Especially if you're just getting into programming and/or JavaScript, this book will briefly explore what you need to get up and going.

This book starts off explaining the basic principles of programming at a very high level. It's mostly intended if you are starting YDKJS with little to no prior programming experience, and are looking to these books to help get you started along a path to understanding programming through the lens of JavaScript.

Chapter 1 should be approached as a quick overview of the things you'll want to learn more about and practice to get into programming. There are also many other fantastic programming introduction resources that can help you dig into these topics further, and I encourage you to learn from them in addition to this chapter.

Once you feel comfortable with general programming basics, Chapter 2 will help guide you to a familiarity with JavaScript's flavor of programming. Chapter 2 introduces what JavaScript is about, but again, it's not a comprehensive guide -- that's what the rest of the YDKJS books are for!

If you're already fairly comfortable with JavaScript, first check out Chapter 3 as a brief glimpse of what to expect from YDKJS, then jump right in!

Practice

There is absolutely no substitute for practice in learning programming. No amount of articulate writing on my part is alone going to make you a programmer.

With that in mind, let's try practicing some of the concepts we learned here in this chapter. I'll give the "requirements," and you try it first. Then consult the code listing below to see how I approached it.

Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of money in your bank account. You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your mental spending threshold.
After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.
Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.
You should set up some constants for the "tax rate," "phone price," "accessory price," and "spending threshold," as well as a variable for your "bank account balance.""
You should define functions for calculating the tax and for formatting the price with a "$" and rounding to two decimal places.
Bonus Challenge: Try to incorporate input into this program, perhaps with the prompt(..) covered in "Input" earlier. You may prompt the user for their bank account balance, for example. Have fun and be creative!
OK, go ahead. Try it. Don't peek at my code listing until you've given it a shot yourself!

Note: Because this is a JavaScript book, I'm obviously going to solve the practice exercise in JavaScript. But you can do it in another language for now if you feel more comfortable.

Here's my JavaScript solution for this exercise:
